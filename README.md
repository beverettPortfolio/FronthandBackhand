# Fronthand Backhand

This is Fronthand Backhand, the winning game for the 2015 UCI VGDC Winter Game Jam.

In a UCI VGDC Game Jam, teams of about 6 students are randomly assigned and then given a theme. The teams then complete a game based on that theme in one weekend. The theme for this game jam was "Choose a side".

The scripts for this game can be found in FronthandBackhand/assets/scripts. My main contributions were the level controller and the GUI scripts. Scripts that I created include BallControllerScript.cs, GUIController.cs, and CameraShakeScript.cs.

A Windows build of Fronthand Backhand is included in FronthandBackhand.zip

How to play:

Use the left and right arrow keys to spin the triangle and the up arrow to flip it vertically. Match the color of the incoming balls to the color of the triangle to increase your score.
